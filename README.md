# TaskTimeCalendar-app-swift
This program is designed to link 3 concepts together: Tasks, Calendars, and Timers.  It uses a Contexual State Chart.  That is a state chart where each state has options for what behavior it executes over time.  The Contexual State Chart is used to store data as well as behavior.

The contexual state chart will be ready soon.
